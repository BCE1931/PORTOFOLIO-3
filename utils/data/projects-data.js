      "I built a full-featured travel booking application using the MERN stack. The app allows users to search for trips, book tickets, view itineraries, and receive booking confirmations via email. I implemented user authentication, role-based access (admin/user), dynamic package filtering, and a secure payment gateway integration. MongoDB stores user and booking data, while Cloudinary handles image uploads.",
